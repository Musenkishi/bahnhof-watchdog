# Bahnhof Watchdog

![](assets/bwatchdog.svg)

Bahnhof Watchdog is a Node.js service that periodically checks for current and planned outages in your area from the ISP named Bahnhof. It also checks if your current subscription is priced higher than what is listed on their website. Notifications are sent via a Discord webhook or via email (Gmail only) if any issues are found.

## Features

- **Outage Check**: Monitors for current and planned outages in your area based on your postal code.
- **Price Check**: Compares your current subscription price with the listed price on Bahnhof's website.
- **Notifications**: Sends notifications about outages or price discrepancies through a Discord webhook or an email.

## Environment Variables

Before running the service, you'll need to set up the following environment variables:

```bash
# Uncomment and set these variables if you are mounting a volume for the data directory.
# PUID=1000
# PGID=1000

# Runs every hour. crontab.cronhub.io can be used to generate another interval
CRON_SCHEDULE="0 * * * *" 

SEND_STARTUP_MESSAGE=true # set to false to avoid getting notified when the service starts

# Outage check
POSTAL_CODE="12345"

# Price check

## Notifications

### Discord Webhook

Ensure `WEBHOOK_URL` is set to your Discord webhook URL. Guide is available on [Discord's support site](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks):

```bash
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url
```

### Email

To use email notifications, all three of the following variables need to be set:

```bash
MAIL_SENDER="your.sender@gmail.com"
MAIL_SENDER_PASS="yourpassword"
MAIL_RECEIVER="your.receiver@gmail.com"
```

These values will configure the service to use Gmail through Nodemailer for sending email notifications. Guide is available [here](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).
